If youâ€™re using Python in the world of data science or scientific computing, you will soon discover that Python has two different packaging systems: pip and Conda.

* which kind of dependencies?

The fundamental difference between pip and Conda packaging is what they put in packages.

Pip packages are Python libraries like NumPy or matplotlib.
Conda packages include Python libraries (NumPy or matplotlib), C libraries (libjpeg), and executables (like C compilers, and even the Python interpreter itself).
